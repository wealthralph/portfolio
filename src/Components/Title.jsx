                                    and Python, secondarily. React is my frontend library of choice, 
                                    and I write my REST APIs in NodeJS. I love GraphQL. 
                                    I love MongoDB and MySQL. I write tests in Jest and Enzyme. I am an active member of Dev.to, and I love to share what I'm learning there, as well as on my blog, thevunderkind.com.</p>
